It really helped me when I just move to United States, and still actually help me to just have fun or get some distraction from work. <br> I did not loose contac with friedn that I left on Mexico and it works to know more people that even right know I can call them "friends" that talks in my language. in that case was impossible to meet and make social activities with other people where was wall just because I not aviable to talk English on that moment.</p>
